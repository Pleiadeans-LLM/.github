## Installation

To get started with Pleiadeans LLM, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pleiadeans-llm.git
    cd pleiadeans-llm
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Quick Start Guide

Here's how to use Pleiadeans LLM to generate text:

```python
from pleiadeans_llm import PleiadeansModel

# Initialize the model
model = PleiadeansModel.from_pretrained('path/to/pretrained/model')

# Generate text
prompt = "Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms."
response = model.generate(prompt, max_length=200)

print("Generated Response:")
print(response)
```

## Usage

- **Text Generation**: Generate high-quality, contextually accurate responses based on prompts.
- **Fine-tuning**: Customize the model for specific applications or domains.
- **Evaluation**: Benchmark the model against various NLP tasks for performance metrics.

## API Reference

### Loading the Model
